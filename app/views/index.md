# {{ serviceName }}

This is a demonstration of how markdown can be used in a prototype.

This prototype comes with some pages:

 - [Content page](/example-content-page)
 - [Accordion](/example-accordion)

You can also [create your own using templates](/manage-prototype/templates) (and scroll down to the GOV.UK Markdown section).
